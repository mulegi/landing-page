The project is meant to showcase all the elements learned so far i.e. all the elements that go into setting up a basiic webpage.

From the basic html elements - linking images, classes, proper use of divs and span, hyperlinks - to styling webpages with flexbox and the CSS grid layout.

Additionally, there's a chunk of git commands that won't necessarily be part of the bog cake but are fundamental to the whole process.
